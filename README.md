# zpentest - Zsh plugin for pentesting

## Description

This plugin adds two functions to your zsh shell:
`penteston` $IP - Sets up your environment with two persistent environment variables:

- $IP: Your target's IP address
- $TUNIP: Your machine's tun0 address

`pentestoff` - Unsets the two environment variables and stops them from persisting. Run this when you're finished with the CTF.

## Installation

OhMyZsh install:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Doc0x1/zpentest.git $ZSH/custom/plugins/zpentest
```

Then add `zpentest` to your plugins array in your `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
plugins=(zpentest)
```

### I've only ever used ohmyzsh, so if you are using a different Zsh plugin manager, you're on your own with figuring out how to add my plugin

- You can always copy the functions to your .zshrc file (or something similar) if you can't get the plugin working.
